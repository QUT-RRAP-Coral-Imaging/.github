Coral Imaging organisation

A collection of repositories for the Queensland University of Technology (QUT)'s Reef Restoration & Adaptation Program (RRAP) code to support the Transition to Deployment (T2D) sub-program.

High density larval rearing is required for scaling coral aquaculture; however, there is a high risk of culture collapse during the 5-7 day process. Early detection is essential to prevent large scale losses, and accurate counts are required to ensure quality control and proper resource allocation. Manual sampling is time-consuming and risks damaging the delicate coral spawn. Automation is essential for scaling the high density larval rearing process. The _Coral Spawn & Larvae Imaging Camera System (CSLICS)_ is a scalable network of cameras to automatically count coral spawn (eggs and larvae) using images and machine learning. Project objectives​: (1) to enable rapid, real-time spawn counts​, (2) minimise manual handling of fragile corals​, (3) quantify fertilisation success​, (4) provide early-warning alerts for culture crashes, (5) store counts in a centralized database for tracking and analysis​, and (5) reduce operational costs for larval rearing.
