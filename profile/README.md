**QUT-RRAP Coral Imaging**

A collection of repositories for the Queensland University of Technology (QUT)'s Reef Restoration & Adaptation Program (RRAP) code to support the Transition to Deployment (T2D) sub-program.

**CSLICS**:

High density larval rearing is required for scaling coral aquaculture; however, there is a high risk of culture collapse during the 5-7 day process. Early detection is essential to prevent large scale losses, and accurate counts are required to ensure quality control and proper resource allocation. Manual sampling is time-consuming and risks damaging the delicate coral spawn. Automation is essential for scaling the high density larval rearing process. 

The _Coral Spawn & Larvae Imaging Camera System (CSLICS)_ is a scalable network of cameras to automatically count coral spawn (eggs and larvae) using images and machine learning. Project objectives​: (1) to enable rapid, real-time spawn counts​, (2) minimise manual handling of fragile corals​, (3) quantify fertilisation success​, (4) provide early-warning alerts for culture crashes, (5) store counts in a centralized database for tracking and analysis​, and (5) reduce operational costs for larval rearing.


**CGRAS**:

Settled coral larvae develop into recruits (2-12 weeks) – counting and assessing recruit health critical to assess deployment readiness​. Understanding recruit distribution on tiles can lead to better yields during growout​. Inventory management and quality assurance - essential for managing logistics across thousands of tiles​. Manual monitoring bottleneck (expert requires 1-2 hours/tile)​. Scale of operation and 2030 targets (10,000 tiles every week for up to 12 weeks)​. Not scalable without automation.
    
The _Coral Growout Robotic Assessment System (CGRAS)_ is a semi-automated platform coral monitoring during growout​, which can be divided into two main components; the Image Capture System (ICS), and the Coral Counting & Visualisation System (CCVS). The Image Capture System is a mobile tank-side camera; avoids tile handling, enables high-throughput imaging​. The Coral counting & visualisation system is software that accepts image from the ICS and then automatically reconstructs the images, detects recruits, monitors health, visualizes trends. The objectives of the project are as follows: (1) deploy mobile trolley for tank-by-tank imaging without moving tiles​, (2) enable automated image capture to reduce tile manipulation and button pressing​, (3) deliver AI-driven coral counts as per-tile spatial heatmaps​, (4) track per-tile coral health trends over time​, and (5) establish digital archive of images and count data for monitoring, quality assurance and research.


**CSLICS Desktop**:

An spin-off of CSLICS, CSLICS Desktop is for providing initial stocking density counts and fertilisation success measures, general larvae counting​. CSLICS Desktop is essentially a more accessible, flexible, computerized imaging system with integrated lights and coral counting models.
